# Quickshot

Quickshot is a menubar image manager. With QuickShot you can drag screenshots from your menubar and drop it wherever you want.

## Description
Quickshot was an app available on the mac app store, but unfortunatelly it is no longer available. There is an alternative called [Screenie] and offers some extra funcictionalities, but I liked the previous one more. So I decided to create my own app (first on mac). 

## Disadvantages of Screenie
 - It opens in menu bar, but window is shown in the middle of the screen (too much movement with mouse)
 - It opens only on main monitor - when user has more monitors, the window is not displayed on active (currenty having mouse in it), but on the main monitor
 
## Features

## Goals

  - Create a popover in macOS,
  - Loose focus on popover,
  - Access folder out of sandbox,
  - Load screenshots in folder,
  - Drag&Drop image wherever user want,
  - Automatically update images, when new ones are added
  - Sorting by date created, modified, etc...
  - Maybe implementing searching (not neccessary because all screenshots have same name, only number is different)
  - Option to start at login
  - Option to quit the app
